		For example, the printer controller controls the paper motion, the print timing. The control lines are
		referred as I/O command. The commands are as following:
		Control command- A control command is issued to activate the peripheral and to inform it what to do.
		Status command- A status command is used to test various status conditions in the interface and the
		peripheral.
		Data Output command- A data output command causes the interface to respond by transferring data
		from the bus into one of its registers.
		Data Input command- The data input command is the opposite of the data output.
